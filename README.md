# Amazon_DataExtraction

Created a session with headers to access the product details to avoid getting detected as a bot.
Added seperate functions to retrieve the product title, price, details and the image url
Created a json output structure to be append as a list of dictionaries
After every 100 product urls the time is calculated in seconds and stored in a variable
The total time is calculated at the end in seconds
The list of json/dictionaries are written in an output.json file.
